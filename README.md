# YamalVegHeterogeneity
This repository includes R scripts that were used to evaluate spatial and temporal heterogeneity in peak growing season aboveground biomass (represented by Max NDVI) and total growing season productivity (represented by time-integrated [TI]-NDVI) on the Yamal Peninsula, Siberia, Russia between 2001 and 2018. Max and TI-NDVI were derived from the MODIS Vegetation Indices product. Climatic, geomorphic, biologic, and anthropogenic variable datasets used in the analysis were derived from a variety of products. Google Earth Engine, ArcMap, and R were used for pre-processing. Only R was used for statistical analyses. Google Earth Engine scripts are available here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/mms3sh/YamalVegHeterogeneity. R scripts that were run using the University of Virginia's HPC (Rivanna) include "Rivanna" in the script name.
